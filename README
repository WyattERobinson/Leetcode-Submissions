Started doing (and tracking) on May 28, 2024

I'm not super knowledgeable on being optimal, or all the intricasies of the languages that I'm using so don't copy these for yourself or anything.
This is just a way for me to document my progress and understanding with languages and coding... genres(?) which will probably be helpful sometime probably maybe hopefully.

I'm practicing C++, so pretty much everything here should be in that language.
